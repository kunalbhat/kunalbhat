%h1 Kunal Bhat is a technologist, futurist, and minimalist UI designer in Chicago.

  My passion is crafting applications. I love prototyping and creating
  proof-of-concept models and interactions. My process cycles between coding
  and visualizing to quickly understand usability and validate design
  decisions. I enjoy puzzles, games, problem solving, and untangling logic.
