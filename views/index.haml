        I am an interaction designer with a background in computer science,
        design, and a focus on web application development.

        My passion is crafting applications. I love prototyping and creating proof-of-concept
        models and interactions. My process cycles between coding and visualizing to quickly
        understand usability and validate design decisions. I enjoy puzzles, games and
        untangling logic.

        I lead design and user-experience for <a href='http://dscout.com' target='_blank'>dscout</a>,
        an in-context mobile research platform and start-up incubated by
        <a href='http://gravitytank.com' target='_blank'>gravitytank</a>, where I work as
        an interaction designer. Prior to that, I was as a designer on both the print
        and interactive sides at <a href='http://vsapartners.com' target='_blank'>VSA Partners</a>.

      %p I am agile, pragmatic and a minimalist.
