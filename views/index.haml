    Hi I'm Kunal. I am an interaction designer with a background in computer science,
    %br/
    design and a focus on web application development.
  %p
    My passion is prototyping and creating proof-of-concept models and interactions.
    My process cycles between coding and visualizing to quickly understand usability
    and validate design decisions. I enjoy puzzles, games and untangling logic.

  %p
    I currently lead design for <a href='http://dscout.com' target='_blank'>dScout</a>,
    an in-context mobile research platform and start-up incubated by
    <a href='http://gravitytank.com' target='_blank'>gravitytank</a>, where I work as
    an interaction designer. Prior to that, I worked as a designer on both the print
    and interactive sides at VSA Partners.

  %p I am agile, pragmatic and a minimalist.
