          %h3 Hi I'm Kunal. I am an interaction designer with a background in computer science, design and a focus on web application development.
          %p
            My passion is prototyping and creating proof-of-concept models and interactions. My process cycles between coding and visualizing
            to quickly understand usability and validate design decisions.

          %p
            I currently lead design for <a href='http://dscout.com' target='_blank'>dScout</a>, an in-context research platform and start-up
            incubated by <a href='http://gravitytank.com' target='_blank'>gravitytank</a>. <br />Prior to that, I worked as a designer on
            both the print and interactive side at VSA Partners.

          %p I am agile, pragmatic and a minimalist.
