## Hello!

### I am a software engineer with ~15 years of building user experiences.

My goal is to use my combined experience from roles in product design, product management, and software engineering to help teams do their best work.

- Currently exploring crypto/web3 as a software engineer at [General Galactic](https://github.com/generalgalactic)
- Most recently I was a product manager at PayPal focused on Identity infrastructure and security experiences
- Prior to that I was a product design lead and frontend-focused engineer for early-stage start-ups Modest and dscout

I love building helpful and thoughtful software!
