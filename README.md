## Hello! I am a product leader with ~15 years of building user experiences.

Hi, I'm Kunal, a product leader in Chicago who brings design perspective and technical acumen via previous experiences as a product designer and design engineer. I've built and shipped early stage product in startups through to enterprise software for global customers.

I specialize in payments via previous experience at PayPal/Braintree, contextual commerce at Modest, and most recently, crypto at Galactic.
